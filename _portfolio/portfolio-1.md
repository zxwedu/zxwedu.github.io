    The project is based on the tsunami simulation data generated by the Numerical model of COMCOT and high resolution remote sensing maps obtained by remote sensing satellites; We extracted road network from the map by MapInfo tools, solved the shortest path for crowd evacuation by Dijkstra algorithm, and finally established a tsunami personnel evacuation plan.
