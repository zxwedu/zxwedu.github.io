I am currently a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China. Prior to this role, I served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub. I completed my Ph.D. at the Australia Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of Technology Sydney, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/ivor.tsang" target="_blank">IEEE Fellow Prof. Ivor Tsang</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csyinjie/" target="_blank">Associate Prof. Jie Jessie Yin</a>. During my doctoral studies, I developed a strong passion for machine learning and deep learning, with a specific focus on trustworthy machine learning. Before this, I worked in XBENTURY, Beijing with <a href="http://www.gaohuang.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Gao Huang</a> (the author of DenseNet). I received the Master of Engineering and Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Ocean University of China in 2017 and 2014, respectively. <a href="https://it.ouc.edu.cn/djy_en/list.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Junyu Dong</a>, was my supervisor. In my current position, I am building on this foundation, exploring and expanding the potential of trustworthy machine learning, image generation and translation, and graph neural networks. My primary goal is to contribute to the development of transparent and reliable machine learning models that can be easily understood and trusted by users across various domains.
